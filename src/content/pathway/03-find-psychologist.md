## How to find a psychologist

<!-- REVIEW -->
You can find a psychologist through:

- **[Psychology Today Australia](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au)** — search by location, issue, and whether they offer Medicare rebates.
- **[Australian Psychological Society (APS) Find a Psychologist](https://psychology.org.au/find-a-psychologist)** — the official APS directory.
- **[healthdirect](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/australian-health-services)** — government directory of health services.
- **Your GP's recommendation** — they may know practitioners in your area with shorter wait times.

## What to check before booking

- **Do they accept Medicare rebates?** Not all do. Ask when you call.
- **What is their session fee?** Fees vary widely ($150–$300+). The Medicare rebate is a fixed amount — the rest is your out-of-pocket cost (the "gap").
- **What is their availability?** Wait times can be weeks or months. Ask about cancellation lists.
- **Do they offer telehealth?** Phone or video sessions can be easier to fit into your schedule and may have shorter wait times.

## Booking your first session

When you call or book online, mention that you have:

1. A **Mental Health Care Plan** from your GP
2. A **referral letter**

They'll ask you to bring both to your first appointment, along with your Medicare card.

## Tips

- **Don't be discouraged by wait times.** Put your name on multiple lists.
- **It's OK to try a different psychologist** if the first one isn't a good fit. You can use your remaining sessions with someone else — just get an updated referral from your GP.
- **Telehealth sessions** receive the same Medicare rebate as in-person sessions.
