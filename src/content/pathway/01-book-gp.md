summary: "Tell your GP you'd like to talk about your mental health. Ask for a longer appointment."

## What to do

Book a standard or long appointment with your GP (general practitioner). When booking, you can say something like:

> "I'd like to discuss my mental health."

<!-- REVIEW -->
A longer appointment (usually 20–40 minutes) gives your GP enough time to do a proper assessment. You can request a long appointment when booking — most clinics will accommodate this.

## What to expect

Your GP will ask about how you've been feeling, how long symptoms have lasted, and how they affect your daily life. This is a conversation, not a test — there are no wrong answers.

<!-- REVIEW -->
They may use a short questionnaire (like the K10 or PHQ-9) to get a picture of your symptoms. This is completely normal and helps them decide the right support for you.

## Tips

- **You don't need to have a "serious" problem.** GPs help with everything from stress and sleep issues to anxiety and depression.
- **Write down what you want to say beforehand.** It can be hard to remember everything in the moment.
- **You can bring someone with you** for support if that helps.
- **Bulk-billing GPs** mean no out-of-pocket cost for the appointment. Use [healthdirect](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/australian-health-services) to find one near you.
