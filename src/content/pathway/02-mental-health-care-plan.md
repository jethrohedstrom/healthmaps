## What is a Mental Health Care Plan?

<!-- REVIEW -->
A Mental Health Care Plan (MHCP) is a document your GP creates during your appointment. It outlines your mental health goals and the treatment approach. Most importantly, it unlocks **Medicare rebates for up to 10 psychology sessions per calendar year**.

You don't need to do anything special — just have the conversation with your GP, and they'll create the plan as part of that appointment.

## What happens during the appointment

<!-- REVIEW -->
Your GP will:

1. **Assess your mental health** — talking through your symptoms, history, and how you're coping.
2. **Create the MHCP** — this includes your goals (e.g., "reduce anxiety", "improve sleep") and a recommended treatment approach.
3. **Write a referral** — you'll get a referral letter to take to a psychologist (or other mental health professional).

The whole process usually happens in one longer appointment.

## Important details

<!-- REVIEW -->
- **Cost:** The MHCP appointment itself is covered under Medicare if your GP bulk-bills. If not, you'll pay the standard GP gap fee.
- **10 sessions per calendar year:** You get up to 10 Medicare-rebated sessions per calendar year (January–December). This resets each year.
- **Review after 6 sessions:** Your GP needs to do a brief review after your first 6 sessions before you can access the remaining 4. This is a short GP appointment.
- **MHCPs can't be "transferred":** If you change GPs, your new GP will need to write a new MHCP. The plan stays with the GP, not with you.

## Tips

- **Ask for a copy** of your MHCP and referral letter.
- **You choose your psychologist.** Your GP may suggest someone, but you're free to find your own.
- **The referral is usually valid for 12 months**, but check with your psychologist's clinic.
