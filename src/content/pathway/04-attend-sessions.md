## Your first session

<!-- REVIEW -->
Your first session is usually an **intake or assessment session**. Your psychologist will:

- Ask about your background, what brought you in, and what you'd like to work on
- Explain how therapy works and what approach they use (e.g., CBT, ACT)
- Start building a therapeutic relationship — this is one of the most important parts of therapy

Bring your **MHCP, referral letter, and Medicare card** to the first session.

## Claiming your Medicare rebate

<!-- REVIEW -->
There are two ways to claim:

1. **At the clinic** — many clinics process your rebate on the spot. You pay the full fee, and the rebate goes back to your bank account within a few days.
2. **Through Medicare** — you can claim online via [myGov](https://my.gov.au) or at a Services Australia office.

The rebate amount depends on the type of practitioner and session length. Your out-of-pocket cost is the difference between the session fee and the rebate.

## GP review after 6 sessions

<!-- REVIEW -->
After your first **6 sessions**, you'll need a brief GP appointment to review your progress. This is a requirement to access sessions 7–10.

This is usually a short appointment where your GP checks in on how things are going and updates your MHCP if needed. It's not a barrier — it's a check-in.

## Tips

- **Sessions are usually weekly or fortnightly**, but your psychologist will discuss what works for you.
- **Cancellation policies** — most psychologists charge a fee for missed sessions or late cancellations (usually 24–48 hours notice required). Medicare won't rebate cancelled sessions.
- **You can change psychologists at any time.** Get an updated referral from your GP pointing to the new practitioner.
