Seeing a psychologist doesn't have to break the bank. Here are practical ways to reduce costs.

## 1. Find a bulk-billing psychologist

Some psychologists charge only the Medicare rebate amount, meaning your out-of-pocket cost is **$0**. They're harder to find and may have longer wait times, but they exist. Ask your GP, check headspace centres, or search community health centres.

## 2. Use your EAP first

If your employer offers an Employee Assistance Program, use those free sessions while you're waiting for a psychology appointment. It's not "wasting" them — it's getting support sooner.

## 3. Check your private health insurance

Some extras policies cover part of the psychology gap. Check your policy or call your insurer. Note: you generally can't claim both a Medicare rebate and a private health insurance rebate for the same session.

## 4. Ask about sliding scale fees

Some psychologists offer reduced rates based on financial hardship. It's worth asking — the worst they can say is no.

## 5. Consider a general psychologist vs. clinical

General psychologists often charge lower fees. The Medicare rebate is lower too (~$93 vs ~$149), but the gap may still be smaller. For many common issues like anxiety and depression, a general psychologist is perfectly appropriate.

## 6. Try telehealth

Telehealth sessions sometimes have lower fees, and they save you transport costs. The Medicare rebate is the same as in-person sessions.

## 7. Look into low-cost options

- **headspace** (ages 12–25) — free or very low-cost sessions
- **Community health centres** — often offer subsidised psychology
- **University psychology clinics** — supervised trainee psychologists at reduced rates (typically $20–$50 per session)
