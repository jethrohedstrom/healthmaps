<!-- REVIEW -->

It's completely normal to feel awkward or unsure about what to say. Here are some ready-to-use phrases.

## When booking the appointment

Say to the receptionist:

> "I'd like to book a longer appointment to discuss my mental health."

That's it. You don't need to give details to the receptionist.

## When you're with the GP

You don't need a perfect explanation. Any of these are fine:

- "I've been feeling anxious/down/overwhelmed and I'd like to talk about it."
- "I think I might benefit from seeing a psychologist. Can we set up a Mental Health Care Plan?"
- "I've been struggling with my mental health and I'm not sure where to start."

## If you're worried about being dismissed

Some people worry their GP won't take them seriously. A few things that help:

- **Be specific about how it's affecting you:** "I'm having trouble sleeping" or "I've been avoiding social situations" is more concrete than "I feel bad."
- **Mention how long it's been going on:** "This has been happening for a few months" helps your GP understand it's not just a bad day.
- **Write it down beforehand.** It's completely OK to read from notes or hand your GP a written summary.

## If your GP isn't helpful

Not every GP is equally comfortable with mental health. If your GP dismisses your concerns or you don't feel heard:

- **You can see a different GP.** You don't owe your GP loyalty — your mental health matters.
- **Look for a GP who lists mental health as an interest** on the clinic's website.
- **headspace** centres (for ages 12–25) have GPs who specialise in youth mental health.
