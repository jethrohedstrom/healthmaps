<!-- REVIEW -->

Finding a psychologist is a bit like finding a good mechanic — qualifications matter, but so does the relationship.

## What to check before booking

1. **Are they registered?** Look them up on the [AHPRA register](https://www.ahpra.gov.au/Registration/Registers-of-Practitioners.aspx). All psychologists must be registered to practise in Australia.
2. **Do they accept Medicare rebates?** Not all do — ask when you call.
3. **What's their session fee?** And what's the gap after the rebate?
4. **Do they have experience with your issue?** A psychologist who specialises in anxiety may be a better fit than a generalist if anxiety is your main concern.
5. **Do they offer telehealth?** Phone or video sessions can be more accessible.

## Questions to ask in your first session

- "What approach do you use?" (CBT, ACT, psychodynamic, etc.)
- "How many sessions do you think I'll need?"
- "What does a typical session look like?"

## How to know if they're a good fit

After 2–3 sessions, ask yourself:

- Do I feel heard and understood?
- Am I comfortable being honest with them?
- Do I feel like we're working on something, not just chatting?

**It's OK if the answer is "not really."** A good therapeutic relationship is the strongest predictor of therapy success. If it's not clicking, it's better to try someone else than to push through.

## Changing psychologists

You can switch at any time. Just:

1. Tell your current psychologist (or just stop booking — you don't owe an explanation).
2. Ask your GP for an updated referral to the new psychologist.
3. Your remaining Medicare sessions carry over — you don't lose them.
