<!-- REVIEW — This is a fictional composite story for illustrative purposes -->

Work was crushing me. I was a team lead managing a restructure, and I started getting headaches, losing sleep, and snapping at my partner. I knew something had to change but I didn't have time to wait weeks for an appointment.

## Starting with EAP

A colleague mentioned our company's Employee Assistance Program. I called the number from our intranet and had an appointment within three days — on the phone, during my lunch break. It was free and confidential.

The counsellor was great. She helped me see that what I was dealing with was burnout, not just "being busy." I used my three sessions to get some immediate coping strategies.

## Moving to a psychologist

The EAP counsellor suggested I might benefit from longer-term support and recommended I see my GP about a Mental Health Care Plan. My GP was supportive, created the plan, and referred me to a clinical psychologist.

The clinical psych charged $280 per session, but because she was a clinical psychologist, my Medicare rebate was about $149 — so my gap was around $131 per session.

## What helped

Having the EAP as a "bridge" was really valuable. I didn't have to wait in silence — I got immediate support while the longer-term plan came together.

**My advice:** If your workplace has an EAP, use it. It's not just for people in crisis, and it can be a great first step.
