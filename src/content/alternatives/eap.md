<!-- REVIEW -->
## What is an EAP?

An Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is a confidential counselling service provided by many Australian employers. Sessions are **completely free** and usually available to you and your immediate family members.

## How it works

- **No referral needed** — you contact the EAP provider directly.
- **Typically 3–6 sessions** per issue per year.
- **Confidential** — your employer is not told who uses the service or what you discuss. They only receive de-identified usage statistics.
- **Available for a wide range of issues** — stress, anxiety, relationship problems, grief, work conflict, and more.

## How to access it

1. Check your employee handbook, intranet, or ask HR for the EAP provider name and phone number.
2. Call the EAP provider and book a session.
3. Attend your session — in person, by phone, or via video.

## Good for

- **Quick access** — often available within days, not weeks.
- **Short-term support** — if you need someone to talk to now while waiting for a psychologist.
- **Work-related stress** — EAP counsellors are experienced with workplace issues.

## Limitations

- Limited number of sessions (usually 3–6).
- Counsellors may not be psychologists — they're often counsellors or social workers.
- Not ideal for complex or ongoing mental health conditions.
