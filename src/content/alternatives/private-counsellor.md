<!-- REVIEW -->
## What is a private counsellor?

A private counsellor or therapist is a mental health professional you can see without a GP referral or MHCP. You pay the full session fee yourself — **Medicare rebates don't apply** to counsellors (only to registered psychologists and some other allied health professionals with a valid MHCP referral).

## How it works

- **No referral needed** — book directly.
- **Session costs:** Typically $80–$200 per session.
- **No Medicare rebate** — you pay the full amount.
- **Private health insurance** may partially cover sessions depending on your policy (check your extras cover).

## When to consider this option

- You want to **start therapy quickly** and can afford to pay privately.
- Your concerns are **mild to moderate** (e.g., stress, life transitions, relationship issues).
- You don't want to go through the GP/MHCP process.
- You've **used your 10 Medicare sessions** for the year and want to continue seeing someone.

## How to find a counsellor

- **[Australian Counselling Association](https://www.theaca.net.au/find-a-counsellor.php)** — search for registered counsellors.
- **[Relationships Australia](https://www.relationships.org.au)** — offers counselling on a sliding fee scale.

## Things to check

- **Qualifications** — look for membership in the Australian Counselling Association (ACA) or Psychotherapy and Counselling Federation of Australia (PACFA).
- **Experience with your issue** — ask about their areas of specialisation.
- **Sliding scale fees** — some counsellors offer reduced rates based on financial hardship.
