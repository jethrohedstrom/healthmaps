<!-- REVIEW -->
## What they do

Psychiatrists are **medical doctors** who specialise in mental health. They can **diagnose conditions, prescribe medication, and provide therapy**. They have the most extensive training of all mental health professionals.

## When to see a psychiatrist

- Complex or long-term mental health conditions that need specialist care
- When medication may be needed or needs to be reviewed
- When your GP wants a specialist opinion
- Conditions that haven't responded to standard psychological therapy

## Medicare access

Requires a **GP referral** — the same kind of referral you'd get for any other specialist. You don't need a Mental Health Care Plan (MHCP) for a psychiatrist. Medicare rebates are generally higher than for psychologists, but so are the fees. **No cap on number of sessions** under Medicare.

## Key differences from psychologists

- Can prescribe and manage medication
- Medical doctor with specialist training
- Longer wait times and higher costs
- No MHCP needed — just a standard GP referral
