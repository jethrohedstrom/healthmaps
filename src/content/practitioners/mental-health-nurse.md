<!-- REVIEW -->
## What they do

Mental health nurses are registered nurses with additional training in mental health care. They provide **care coordination, ongoing support, and medication monitoring** for people living with mental health conditions — particularly more complex or chronic conditions. They often work alongside psychiatrists and GPs as part of a broader care team.

## When to see a mental health nurse

- Ongoing management of complex mental health conditions (e.g. bipolar disorder, schizophrenia)
- Medication monitoring and support
- When you need regular check-ins and care coordination
- When your psychiatrist or GP recommends additional support between appointments
- When you need help navigating the mental health system

## Medicare access

Medicare access for mental health nurses is **more limited** than for psychologists or social workers. They may be covered under specific GP-arranged care plans or through public mental health services, but are not covered under the standard Better Access scheme in the same way. Check with your GP about what's available.

## Key differences

- Focus on care coordination and ongoing support rather than structured therapy sessions
- Often work as part of a team with psychiatrists and GPs
- Particularly suited to managing complex or chronic conditions
- Can monitor medication effects and side effects
- More limited Medicare rebate access compared to psychologists
