<!-- REVIEW -->
## What they do

Mental health occupational therapists (OTs) focus on **functional recovery** — helping you get back to doing the things that matter in your daily life. They work on practical skills like managing routines, returning to work or study, building independence, and developing coping strategies for everyday situations.

They must hold a **mental health accreditation** to provide Medicare-rebated sessions under the Better Access scheme.

## When to see a mental health OT

- When mental health is affecting your ability to work, study, or manage daily tasks
- Difficulty maintaining routines or self-care
- Returning to work or study after a mental health episode
- When you want practical, skills-based support rather than traditional talk therapy
- When you need help building structure and independence in daily life

## Medicare access

Requires a **Mental Health Care Plan (MHCP)** and **GP referral**. Up to 10 Medicare-rebated sessions per calendar year under the Better Access scheme. Must hold a mental health accreditation.

## Key differences

- Focuses on practical, day-to-day functioning rather than exploring emotions or past experiences
- Helps you build routines, structure, and coping skills for real-life situations
- Particularly useful when mental health is affecting your ability to work or study
- Same Medicare rebate structure as general psychologists
