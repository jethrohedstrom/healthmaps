<!-- REVIEW -->
## What they do

Counsellors provide **talk therapy** for a range of personal, emotional, and relational issues. They use approaches like person-centred therapy, solution-focused therapy, and narrative therapy.

## When to see a counsellor

- Relationship or family issues
- Grief and loss
- Life transitions (career changes, divorce, retirement)
- Stress and mild anxiety
- When you want someone to talk to without needing a GP appointment or Mental Health Care Plan first

## Medicare access

**No Medicare rebate.** Counsellors are not covered under the Better Access scheme. You pay the full session fee. Some private health insurance extras policies may cover part of the cost.

## Key differences from psychologists

- Generally shorter training requirements
- No Medicare rebate available
- No referral needed — you can book directly
- Typically lower session fees
- Often shorter wait times
- May not be suitable for complex clinical conditions
