<!-- REVIEW -->
## What they do

Psychotherapists provide **in-depth talk therapy**, often focusing on underlying patterns, past experiences, and long-term personal growth. Approaches include psychodynamic therapy, schema therapy, and gestalt therapy.

## When to see a psychotherapist

- Deep-rooted emotional patterns or recurring relationship issues
- Trauma and complex grief
- Self-understanding and personal growth
- When you want longer-term, explorative therapy rather than short-term skill-building

## Medicare access

**Generally no Medicare rebate** — unless the psychotherapist is also a registered psychologist (in which case the standard psychology rebates apply with an MHCP). Check their qualifications.

## Key differences from psychologists

- "Psychotherapist" is not a protected title in Australia — anyone can use it
- Look for accreditation with **PACFA** (Psychotherapy and Counselling Federation of Australia)
- More focus on in-depth exploration vs. structured skill-based approaches
- Sessions may be longer (50–90 minutes)
