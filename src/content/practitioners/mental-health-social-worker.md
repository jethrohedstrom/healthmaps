<!-- REVIEW -->
## What they do

Mental health social workers are trained to understand how **social, emotional, and environmental factors** affect mental health. They help with issues like relationship breakdowns, housing stress, financial difficulties, family conflict, and workplace problems — particularly where these are contributing to anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions.

They use evidence-based therapies including CBT, narrative therapy, and strengths-based approaches. They must be **accredited by the Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW)** to provide Medicare-rebated sessions.

## When to see a mental health social worker

- When social or life circumstances are a major factor in your mental health (e.g. housing, finances, relationships)
- Family or relationship breakdowns
- Domestic or family violence
- Grief, loss, or major life transitions
- When you want a practitioner who considers your whole situation, not just symptoms

## Medicare access

Requires a **Mental Health Care Plan (MHCP)** and **GP referral**. Up to 10 Medicare-rebated sessions per calendar year under the Better Access scheme. Must be an AASW-accredited mental health social worker.

## Key differences

- Focuses on social determinants of mental health, not just clinical symptoms
- Strong understanding of community services and support systems
- Can help connect you with other services (housing, legal, financial counselling)
- Same Medicare rebate structure as general psychologists
