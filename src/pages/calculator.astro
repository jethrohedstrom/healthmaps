        <!-- REVIEW -->
        <p>
          When you see a psychologist with a valid <strong>Mental Health Care Plan (MHCP)</strong> and GP referral,
          Medicare pays back a fixed amount per session — this is the <strong>rebate</strong>. The difference between
          the session fee and the rebate is your <strong>out-of-pocket cost</strong> (also called the "gap").
        </p>
        <p>
          You can receive up to <strong>10 Medicare-rebated sessions per calendar year</strong> (January–December).
          After your first 6 sessions, your GP needs to do a brief review before you can access sessions 7–10.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some psychologists <strong>bulk-bill</strong>, meaning they charge only the Medicare rebate amount — so your
          out-of-pocket cost is $0. However, bulk-billing psychologists often have longer wait times.
